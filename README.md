# Solidity Chat GPT Test Tasks Project

This repository hosts a project that emerged from a self-driven learning experience involving AI, specifically Chat GPT 4.0, to enhance my skills in Solidity and smart contract development. Below is a brief narrative of the journey and the project specifics.

## Background

In my case, the best way to quickly and efficiently master a new area of development is to simply start writing code. I study theory, but with a focus on practical problems; otherwise, there is always a risk of falling into the so-called “Tutorial Hell.” However, this time I decided to take a new approach in my training and turned to AI for help.

I approached Chat GPT 4.0 with a peculiar request: "Pretend to be an employer in need of a smart contract developer and assign me a test task." 

Next, Chat GPT began assigning me test tasks. After I received a task, I started writing code. When I was confident in the written smart contract, I sent it back to Chat GPT for verification. It provided VERY detailed feedback, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of the code, and offering recommendations for the future. If necessary, I submitted an improved version of the code after receiving recommendations from Chat GPT and again received feedback from it.

I really enjoyed the experience after completing the first task and continued to engage in this method to train my skills. Subsequent test tasks varied both in content and level of difficulty. If I needed to practice writing code for a specific standard, I directly told Chat GPT that I needed a task based on, for example, ERC-721.

## Conclusion

Of course, Chat GPT or other AI cannot be the only assistant in mastering smart contract development; documentation, open repositories, and forums are also very useful. However, in my opinion, it is an excellent addition to the process of mastering a new area of development, especially in terms of the speed of receiving feedback.

## Task Contract Overview

This particular repo is the result of the first task assigned by Chat GPT. Below is the task description provided by Chat GPT:

### Task Description

**Title**: Development of a Smart Contract for Managing a Task List

**Objective**: Craft a Solidity smart contract to manage a simplistic task list, illustrating basic data handling and function implementations.

**Requirements**:

- **Data Structure**:
  - `Task` Structure with fields:
    - `uint256 taskId` (unique task identifier)
    - `string taskDescription` (task description)
    - `bool isCompleted` (task completion flag)
  
- **Functions**:
  - `createTask(string memory _description)` - for creating a new task with a unique identifier.
  - `toggleTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId)` - for toggling the task's completion status.
  - `getTask(uint256 _taskId)` - for fetching task information using its identifier.
  - `getAllTasks()` - for retrieving an array of all tasks.

- **Testing**:
  - Ensure the smart contract operates correctly in an Ethereum smart contract execution environment like Remix.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Correctness of data structure and function implementation.
- Code quality and clarity.
- Correct handling and status toggling of tasks.
- Potential code improvements and optimizations.

The solution should be presented in Solidity code format.
